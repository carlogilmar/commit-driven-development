# Guideline for Elixir 

Consider this approach is considering you're using a [mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html) project. This is just a simple guide for novice developers starting their journey in the BEAM world.

## Tooling 

- [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html)
- [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo)
- [Dialyxir](https://github.com/jeremyjh/dialyxir)

## Considerations 

- Run often `mix format` to format your code and commit this.
- Run credo to make the code analysis before to push your code, if there are warnings fix it and commit this.
- Run dialyzer before push your code to run the code analysis, if there are warning or errors fix it.
