# üß© Commit Driven Development

> Repo to show some ideas presented in Git Merge 2022 Chicago by Carlo Gilmar.

[üîó Git Merge 2022 Talk Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/CarloGilmarPadillaSa/git-merge-2022)

# üöÄ Code features using Commit Driven Development 

1. Think first about how to solve your feature and break it up in small steps.
2. Write down a bullet list with this small steps. Every description should represent one of your steps. 
3. Write the lines of code that achieve your steps.
4. After made your commits, read your git log history, this should represent your building process.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Values

- Order and clarity before commit your code.
- Great communication telling how you're coding. 
- Open to feedback and ask questions.
- Invest time in your tools, invest time learning and using git.

# üèÜ Achievements

- You're able to **read your own building code story** following just the commit descriptions (like reading a cook recipe). 
- You're able to **reproduce the building process** through explore every commit using `git show`.
- Anyone from your team should be able to **follow your coding process**.
- Anyone from your team should be able to **reproduce your coding process**.
- Anyone outside your team, **but with enough context about your stack**, should be able to follow your coding process.
- Anyone outside your team should be able to reproduce your coding process **just using git**.

# ü§î When to use? 

- You can use this technique before code any feature, this will enforce you to have enough clarity and ask you questions that probably you'll have to ask to your team as well. 
- Building features in this way will give you a way to track your building process in the commit history. You can use this to share with your team.
- If your team is using this approach, you'll be able to learn about their building process. 
- You can incorporate this to your onboarding process of new joiners to teach them how your team is working.
