This is just a technique not just to write better commits, it's a way to achieve clarity and increase your order before code. In honor to Test Driven Development, this is about **write your commits before write your code**. 

# Steps ðŸ‘£

1. Think about your feature, break it up in small steps about how to solve it in code.
2. Write down a list of commit descriptions. Every commit should represent one of your steps. 
3. Try to write atomic descriptions and be specific with your commits.
4. Code your steps.

# Extra Steps ðŸš€

5. Read your commit history log, can you recognize your build process through your commits? 
6. Give your branch to another collegue and ask him about what could he read in your commit log.
